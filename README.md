# Java_Encryption_Decryption_project

This project is basicaly  a file encryption using AES standards in java language
present accuracy of encryption security is approx~45% 

# AES (Advanced Encryption Standards) Algorithm :

This algorithm is basically a advance symmetric-key encryption recently adopted by US govt and is currently being used widely for the security features

This Algorithm works on the basis of two **Keys** i.e : 

Public Key - this key is sent to user for decryption alongside encrypted data.

Private key - this key is an encrypted key which is generated at the time of encryptionby a keyword entered by the user in the key section of code.

This Kind of encryption are currently being used in many messaging/trading apps to secure thier files and transaction status.
