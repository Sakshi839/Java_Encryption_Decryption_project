# Java_Encryption_Decryption_project

This project is basicaly  a file encryption using AES standards in java language
present accuracy of encryption security is approx~45% 

---AES Algorithm--------
This algorithm is now adopted by US govt and is presently used widely to sequre the files on the basis of one public key and the second private key 
Aes stands for symmetric-key algorithm
this type of similar encryption is used in many messaging apps.

#Contributions:
This project is open for contributions
contributers are most welcome

issues :
1. want to build the gui version of this algorithm.
2. want to increase the accuracy of the algorithm.
  presently it is approx ~45%
